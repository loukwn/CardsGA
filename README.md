# CardsGA

Genetic algotithm that solves (or approaches the solution of) the problem of placing 10 cards (numbered 1-10) in two stacks with the restriction that the sum of cards in the first stack should be 36 and the product of the cards in the second should be 360. The ability to experiment with different sum/product targets and card ranges exists via the use of the second constructor (see example). 

The code is in the CardsGenAlgo.cpp, CardsGenAlgo.h files, while a demo VS solution is included to run the algorithm.

Developed as part of a semester project of my Computational Intelligence class.
